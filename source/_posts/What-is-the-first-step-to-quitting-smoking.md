2. Figure out your triggers for smoking and come up with strategies to deal with them. Triggers can include stress, boredom, or alcohol use.

3. Quit gradually or cold turkey. Most people find that quitting gradually is easier, but some people find it more difficult to stick with. Quitting cold turkey is more likely to cause cravings, but it may be easier in the long run if you are able to stay smoke-free.

4. Get rid of all cigarettes and ashtrays in your home and car. This will help remove temptation and make it easier not to smoke relapse .

5. Make sure you have adequate support from family or friends during the quitting process . Talk about your plans with them and ask for their help in avoiding situations where you might be tempted to smoke .

#  What is the second step to quitting smoking?

If you're like most people, you may think that the second step in quitting smoking is to find a way to replace the nicotine in cigarettes with something else. But according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, that's not actually the second step.

The second step is to make a plan. The first step is to make the decision to quit smoking, and the next step is to put together a plan that will help you succeed. This may include setting a date for quitting, figuring out which strategies will work best for you, and preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for quitting.

There are many different ways to quit smoking, and different things will work for different people. Some popular methods include using nicotine replacement therapy (such as patches, gum, or nasal sprays), going cold turkey, or using prescription medications such as Chantix or Zyban.

One thing that's important when choosing a method is to make sure it's something you can commit to. If you choose a method that's too difficult or involves too many changes, you're less likely to stick with it. It's also important to find a support group or friend who can help keep you on track.

Once you've picked a method, it's important to prepare yourself for the challenges ahead. Quitting smoking can be difficult, and there will be times when you want to give up. But remember that it's worth it! Quitting smoking will not only improve your health, but it will also save you money in the long run.
