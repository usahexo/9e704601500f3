# What Are The Rules Of Poker?

At its core, poker is a simple game that can be learned in just a few minutes. The object of the game is to win as many chips as possible by either winning individual hands or taking down the entire pot. Here are the basic rules:

1) In Texas Hold’em, each player is dealt two cards face down (hole cards), then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages: called flop (3 cards), turn (4th card), and river (5th card). The player with the best five-card combination using any combination of their own hole cards and community cards wins the pot. If there is more than one player remaining after all the cards have been dealt, the player with the best hand wins the pot or splits it evenly if there is a tie.

2) In Omaha Hi-Lo split pot games, each player receives four hole cards instead of two (the highest ranking hand splits the pot with the lowest ranking hand). As with Texas Hold’em games, 5 community cards are dealt face up in three stages: called flop (3 cards), turn (4th card), and river (5th card). The player with the best five-card combination using any combination of their own hole cards and community cards wins half of the pot (the highest ranking hand), while the player with the worst hand(s) loses half of the pot (the lowest ranking hand). If there is more than one remaining player after all the cards have been dealt, ties are broken first by highest ranked pair in unmatched hands , then by highest kicker . If there is still a tie , then both players split the pot evenly . 3) In 7 Card Stud each player begins with two face down downcards (holecards) followed by one face up card per round until four rounds have been played - thus seven total faceup cards - three shared between all players as their 3rd Street card followed one at a time starting 4th street onwards till seventh street which is another shared card among all active players at showdown . The best 5 card poker hand takes origin from only these 7 face up Cards .
