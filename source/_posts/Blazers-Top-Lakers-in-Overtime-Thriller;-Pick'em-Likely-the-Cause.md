#  Blazers Top Lakers in Overtime Thriller; Pick'em Likely the Cause

The Portland Trail Blazers came out on top of a thriller against the Los Angeles Lakers in overtime, 122-119. Neither team had more than a five-point lead at any point in the game, and it was only settled in OT.

While Damian Lillard led all scorers with 36 points on the night, it was teammate CJ McCollum who was the key to victory. McCollum hit some huge shots in overtime, including a go-ahead jumper with under a minute remaining that proved to be the game-winner.

Both teams shot over 50% from the field on the night, but it was Portland's 14 three pointers that proved to be the difference. The Lakers were forced to foul in the closing minutes of OT, and Portland made their free throws to seal the victory.

With both teams now sitting at 39-22 on the season, this loss hurts the Lakers' chances of catching Golden State for first place in the Western Conference. It's looking more and more like there will be a three-way battle for second place between Portland, Houston, and Oklahoma City.

This was also a crucial game for playoff seeding, as both teams are currently vying for homecourt advantage in the first round. The Blazers have now taken over fourth place from Utah, while LA drops to fifth.

The loss leaves Portland with a one-and-a-half game lead over Golden State for first place in the Western Conference. The Lakers are now two games out of playoff contention.

Portland was without Jusuf Nurkic, who was sidelined with a sprained ankle. Their depth was tested, but they managed to prevail.

It was a wild game that featured 18 lead changes and 11 ties. The Blazers are now 6-0 on the road this season and continue to be one of the NBAâ€™s best teams.

Portland led by as many as 14 in the first half, but the Lakers made a run in the third quarter to get within striking distance. However, McCollum and Co. reasserted themselves in the fourth, outscoring LA 29-20 to seal the victory.

#  Undefeated Blazers Rout Lakers for Sixth Win in a Row

The Portland Trail Blazers continue to make history this season. On Tuesday night, they routed the Los Angeles Lakers 125-112 for their sixth consecutive win and remain undefeated in 2019.

This latest victory was especially impressive as it came on the road against a Lakers team that had won nine of its last 10 games. The Blazers were led by Damian Lillard, who scored 35 points on 13-of-25 shooting and added eight assists. CJ McCollum added 26 points, and Jusuf Nurkic finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds.

Portland's defense was also stout, holding the Lakers to 42 percent shooting from the field and just 33 percent shooting from three-point range.

The Blazers have now matched their best start in franchise history with a record of 19-4. They will look to keep the momentum going when they host the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night.
