#  Louisiana Casino Association Launches Campaign to Bring Wilder Gambling Boom to the State 

The Louisiana Casino Association has announced a campaign to bring more gambling opportunities to the state. The campaign is hoping to capitalize on the recent voter approval of Amendment 4, which will allow for twenty new casinos across the state.

According to LCA Executive Director Ann Duplessis, “This is a great opportunity for Louisiana. We expect these new casinos to create thousands of jobs and bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each year.”

The LCA is proposing a number of different casino projects, including a $750 million development near Baton Rouge, a $450 million development near Lake Charles, and a $350 million development near New Orleans.

Critics say that the campaign is simply an attempt by the casino industry to exploit vulnerable people. But supporters argue that the new casinos will bring much-needed economic growth to the state.

#  Louisiana Poised to Open Up a New Casino as Part of Expansion Plan 

Louisiana is planning to open a new casino as part of an expansion plan that is expected to create 1,500 jobs. The new casino will be located in Baton Rouge and is scheduled to open in 2020.

The expansion plan also includes the construction of a new hotel and conference center. The goal is to make Baton Rouge more of a destination for tourists and business travelers.

This is not the first time Louisiana has undertaken an expansion project aimed at bolstering its casino industry. In 2016, the state opened a new casino in Lake Charles. That casino has been a success, and lawmakers are hoping for similar results from the new casino in Baton Rouge.

One reason for the optimism is that Louisiana has seen a surge in gambling revenue in recent years. In 2017, gambling revenue totaled $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion in 2016. Part of the reason for this increase is that Louisiana has become more competitive with other states that offer gaming options such as casinos and horse racing.

Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, has voiced his support for the expansion project, saying it will create much-needed jobs in the state. He also praised the potential economic benefits that the new casino could bring to Baton Rouge.

Not everyone is happy about the expansion plan, however. The anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling has come out against it, arguing that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and other social problems.

#  Study Shows Benefits to Louisiana from Opening a New Casino 

A recent study done by the LSU Public Affairs Research Lab has shown that Louisiana stands to benefit economically from opening a new casino. The study found that the state could see as much as $264 million in new tax revenue and as many as 4,000 new jobs created by such a venture.

“The potential exists for a new casino development to create significant economic impact for the state of Louisiana,” saidLab director Michael Henderson.

While there are some who oppose casinos on moral grounds, the reality is that they are a major source of revenue for states and create thousands of jobs. In addition to the economic benefits, casinos also provide an entertainment option for residents and tourists alike.

It is clear that Louisiana would benefit from opening a new casino and I believe lawmakers should seriously consider this option.

#  Louisiana Moves Forward with Plans to Open a Casino in Wilder 

Louisiana is moving forward with plans to open a casino in the town of Wilder. The new casino is expected to create hundreds of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state.

The Wilder casino will be operated by the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and it is expected to be up and running by early 2020. The tribe has already started construction on the casino, which will include a hotel, restaurants, and a gaming floor.

The Choctaw Nation says that the new casino will be a major boon to the local economy, creating hundreds of jobs and generating millions of dollars in revenue for the state. Officials in Louisiana are hopeful that the casino will help attract tourists to the area and boost the local economy.

Casinos have been shown to be a major source of revenue for states, generating billions of dollars in tax revenue each year. In addition, casinos create thousands of jobs in areas where they are located, and they often serve as a major tourist attraction.

Several other states have recently opened new casinos, including Iowa, Mississippi, and West Virginia. These casinos are expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue for their states and create thousands of jobs.

#  Louisiana Gaming Commission Approves Plans for New Casino in Wilder

The Louisiana Gaming Commission has given the green light to a new casino in the town of Wilder. The commission voted unanimously to approve the plans, which will see the construction of a new $40 million casino in the town.

The casino will be operated by Pinnacle Entertainment and is expected to create around 300 jobs. It is hoped that the new casino will help to revive Wilder’s fortunes, which have been in decline for some time.

The commission also approved amendments to Pinnacle’s license, which will allow it to offer sports betting at its other casinos in Louisiana. This decision was also unanimous, with Pinnacle Entertainment praising the commission for its support.

“We are grateful for the unanimous vote by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board granting our application for a Category 2 license amendment,” said Anthony Sanfilippo, president and CEO of Pinnacle Entertainment.

“This amendment will allow us to offer sports betting across our Louisiana portfolio including L’Auberge Baton Rouge and L’Auberge Lake Charles, as well as at our future property in Wilder.”

Construction of the new casino is expected to start in early 2019, with it opening later that year. It will be located on Highway 54 near the intersection with Highway 190 and will feature around 500 slot machines and 22 table games.
