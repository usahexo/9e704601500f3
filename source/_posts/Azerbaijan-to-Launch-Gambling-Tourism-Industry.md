#  Azerbaijan to Launch Gambling Tourism Industry


Azerbaijan is set to launch a gambling tourism industry in early 2019. The industry is expected to generate nearly $100 million in revenue over the next five years.

The gambling tourism industry will be based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. The government of Azerbaijan has allocated 100 hectares of land for the development of the industry.

The first phase of the project will include the construction of a hotel and casino complex. The complex will have 500 rooms and a gaming area with 50 tables and 200 slots.

The second phase of the project will include the construction of an entertainment district with a theme park, concert hall, and shopping mall.

Azerbaijan has been working on the project for two years. The government has selected two companies to operate the casino and hotel complex.

#  Azerbaijan Targets US$100 Million in Gambling Revenue

Azerbaijan is planning to boost its gambling revenue to US$100 million in 2020 as part of efforts to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil money, the head of the country’s state gambling regulator said on Wednesday.

revenue from gambling in Azerbaijan totaled around $25 million last year, up from $20 million in 2017, according to the State Gambling Department.

The sector currently employs some 2,000 people, and authorities want to raise that number to 10,000 over the next three years.

“We are expecting a stable growth rate for gambling income in 2020 and it will amount to about $100 million,” Safar Mammadov, head of the State Gambling Department said at a conference in Baku.

The department forecasts that by 2025 the sector will bring in $250 million in revenue and employ 25,000 people.

#  Switzerland May Lose Azerbaijani Gambling Patronage

In recent years, Switzerland has become a hotspot for gambling, with casinos popping up in almost every city. However, this may all change as Azerbaijanis, who have been some of the biggest spenders in Swiss casinos in recent years, are now looking to other destinations for their casino needs.

Azerbaijanis have been among the biggest spenders at Swiss casinos, accounting for 1.5% of all gambling revenue in the country. In addition to spending large sums of money in casinos, many Azerbaijanis also own property in Switzerland.

However, it now appears that this patronage is coming to an end. Azerbaijan is currently in the process of legalizing gambling and is expected to open its own casinos soon. This means that Azerbaijani tourists will no longer need to travel to Switzerland to gamble, and will instead stay in their home country.

This could be bad news for Swiss casino operators. Gambling is an important source of revenue for these businesses, and they may see a decline in profits if Azerbaijani tourists stop spending money in Swiss casinos.

It is still too early to tell what the full impact of Azerbaijan’s legalization of gambling will be on Swiss casinos. However, it is likely that Azerbaijani tourists will start spending their money elsewhere, and Swiss casino operators may need to find new ways to attract customers if they want to continue making profits.

#  Azerbaijan Tightens Noose on Unlicensed Online Gambling Operators

Azerbaijan is reported to have tightened the noose on unlicensed online gambling operators in a bid to stamp out the activity in the country.

Local media reports that the National Agency for Mine Action (NAMA) has been working with the Ministry of Taxes to identify and clamp down on illegal gambling sites, with a particular focus on those that do not hold a licence from the authorities.

Illegal gambling operations have been given a grace period until February 28 to shut down their businesses, after which they will be subject to prosecution. Fines of up to AZN 2 million (USD 1.2 million) are being threatened for those caught operating without authorisation.

The crackdown comes as part of wider efforts by the government to improve Azerbaijan’s tourism offering, which has been hit hard by falling oil prices in recent years. The authorities are seeking to attract more high-value tourists and believe that cracking down on unlicensed gambling will help to achieve this goal.

#  Is Azerbaijan the Next Monaco? Battle Heats Up over Gambling Revenue

Azerbaijan is seeing a rise in gambling and gaming activity as its economy rebounds from the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country has particularly benefitted from a recent liberalization of its gambling laws, and investors are now jockeying for a piece of the action.

Mammad Bagirov, the Azerbaijani businessman who founded the Crystal Casino, is one of the main beneficiaries of this liberalization. His casino has become one of the most popular destinations in Baku, the capital city, and he is planning to open new venues in tourist hotspots like Ganja and Nakhchivan.

 Azerbaijan’s government stands to benefit from the gambling boom as well. The country’s General Prosecutor's Office recently reported that revenue from casinos and other gaming establishments increased by 34 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. This generated nearly 10 million manats (over $6 million USD) in revenue for the government.

The question now is whether Azerbaijan can maintain this momentum and turn into a regional gambling hub like Monaco or Macau. Some industry observers are skeptical, citing corruption and a lack of infrastructure as potential impediments to growth.

Others are more bullish on Azerbaijan’s prospects. They argue that the country already has an advantage over its competitors thanks to its location between Europe and Asia. And with oil prices up, Azerbaijan has more money to invest in gaming development.

Only time will tell if Azerbaijan can emerge as a major player in the global gambling market. In any case, it will be fascinating to watch this emerging industry develop over the coming years.
