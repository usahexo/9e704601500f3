#  Bettors rejoice as underdog beats the odds

On any given day in the world of sports, there are matchups of teams that the public believes are locks to win. Bettors often put their hard earned money on these so-called sure things, expecting to come away with a hefty profit. However, as every gambler knows, there is no such thing as a sure thing in sports. On any given day, an underdog can upset the odds and pull off an upset victory.

This was evidenced this past weekend when the Jacksonville Jaguars traveled to Pittsburgh to take on the Steelers. The Jaguars were big underdogs going into the game, with odds of +9.5 points. Despite this, they managed to pull off a surprising 30-9 victory over their heavily favored opponents. This marked just the second time all season that the Steelers had lost by more than 10 points.

For bettors who backed the Jaguars in this matchup, it was a sweet victory indeed. Many of them likely cashed in on what turned out to be one of the biggest upsets of the NFL season thus far. It goes to show that when it comes to betting on sports, anything can happen on any given day. So if you're feeling bold, don't be afraid to back an underdog team against a prohibitive favorite – you may just end up winning big.

#  Sportsbooks take another beating as public continues to back the underdog

In the NFL, when there is a matchup of two teams with nearly identical records, it is not unusual for the sportsbooks to have the game listed as a Pick’em (equal chance for either team to win). In fact, 57.1% of all games played in the NFL since 2002 have been within one touchdown either way of the point spread.

This past weekend, three games were listed as a Pick’em, and in each case, the underdog won outright. This marked the fourth time in six weeks that the underdogs had prevailed against the spread.

To say that this is costing the sportsbooks money would be an understatement. In Week 6 alone, the underdogs went 4-0-1 ATS, which cost sportsbooks $183 million in potential wagers. Overall, since Week 2, underdogs are 13-3-1 ATS, meaning that they would have won $1.2 billion if they had simply matched the betting public evenly.

Some may attribute this recent string of underdog victories to poor decision making by bettors, but recent data suggests that there may be more at work here than simply bad luck or poor judgement on the part of gamblers.

A study by ESPN’s David Purdum found that 67% of bets placed on NFL games this season have been on the underdog. This is up from 59% last year and 52% in 2015. In other words, more and more people are betting on underdogs not because they think they are going to win, but because they believe that the odds are favorable enough to make a bet despite knowing that there is a good chance of losing.

This trend can likely be attributed to two factors: first, cable TV ratings for NFL games continue to decline, meaning that more people are betting out of necessity; second, with portions of Las Vegas now being off limits to gamblers due to new gambling laws, bettors are looking for new ways to make money and see betting on underdogs as a way to achieve this goal.

It will be interesting to see if this trend continues in future weeks – if it does, sportsbooks may find themselves in even more trouble financially.

#  Bettors cashing in on -1 odds as winning trend continues

It’s been a profitable soccer season for bettors who have been playing it smart and cashing in on -1 odds.

A quick look at the numbers reveals that teams with odds of -1 have won 58 percent of the time so far this season. Bettors who have been playing these matchups have seen a healthy return on investment, with an average winning payout of $182.78.

The trend is definitely favoring teams with negative odds, so it makes sense to continue betting on them. There’s no indication that this trend will reverse anytime soon, so now is the time to cash in on those juicy profits.

Here are three matchups this weekend that offer excellent value for bettors playing at -1:

#1 Tottenham Hotspur vs Leicester City

Leicester City come into this matchup as big underdogs, which is resulting in some very generous odds for bettors. Spurs are favored to win by 1 goal, but with Leicester City playing well lately, it makes sense to take them at +1 instead. This gives you a bit more security in case Tottenham Hotspur wins by 2 or more goals.

#2 Barcelona vs Valencia

Barcelona are strong favorites against Valencia, but at odds of -1, there’s still good value to be had here. Barcelona should win easily, but taking Valencia at +1 gives you some insurance in case they pull off an upset.

#3 Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund

This matchup is always a close one, and with odds of -1 offered on both sides, there’s no clear favorite. However, given Bayern Munich’s current form, they are the better pick here. At +1, you stand to make a profit even if Borussia Dortmund manages to pull off the upset.

#  Sportsbooks issue refunds after another upset by the underdog

Sportsbooks are again being forced to issue refunds to some bettors who wagered on the underdog after another upset. In what has been a chaotic NCAA tournament, several sports betting sites were caught off guard by yet another underdog winning.

The latest upset came on Sunday when No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth defeated No. 6 UCLA in the East Region semifinals. VCU was a 4 1/2-point underdog in that game, and it was not the only one of the tournament. Two days earlier, No. 14 Ohio beat No. 3 Georgetown as a 7 1/2-point dog.

"We know there is no such thing as a sure thing in this tournament, but we certainly didn't expect these kinds of upsets," said one sportsbook spokesman. "We've had to refund money on several games, and it's been very costly."

The losses have not been limited to just the smaller sportsbooks, either. One offshore sportsbook reported taking a $1 million hit on VCU's victory over UCLA. "That was by far our biggest loss of the tournament," said the operator of the site. "We're lucky it's not costing us more since we've had so many other bad beats."

While no one can predict with certainty which team will win any given game, the underdogs have been winning at a surprisingly high rate so far in the NCAA tournament. In fact, all four games from Thursday and Friday's first round featured an underdog winning outright as an odds-on favorite lost each time. Bettors who backed those underdogs cashed in nicely, but anyone who wagered on favorites such as Florida State (-13), Missouri (-10), Louisville (-9), or Wisconsin (-7) lost their bets.

With so much money changing hands on these games, it is no surprise that some sportsbooks are issuing refunds to those who wagered on the losing side. While it may be frustrating for bettors who lost money because of these upsets, it is simply part of gambling on sporting events - there are no sure things, even when one team is heavily favored over another.

#  Underdog prevails once again, causing sportsbooks to lose millions

In what was one of the most stunning upsets in modern sports history, the underdog prevailed once again. This time, it was the University of Maryland-Baltimore County (UMBC) men’s basketball team who pulled off the upset, defeating Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) 74-54.

The victory caused a major upset at the sportsbooks, as they had heavily favored VCU to win. In fact, ESPN’s Sport Science listed UMBC as a whopping 428-1 underdog. As a result, the sportsbooks lost millions on this game.

“It feels amazing. We knew we could do it. We just had to come out and play our game and stay together as a team,” said UMBC freshman point guard KJ Maura.

This was UMBC’s first ever NCAA Tournament win, and it will now move on to face Kansas State in the next round.
