#  Playing the Odds: Why Even Numbers Are Better for Roulette 

When you’re playing the roulette wheel, you want to make sure that you’re using the best odds possible. That’s why even numbers are generally better than odd numbers.

An even number is when the sum of the two numbers is an even number. An odd number is when the sum of the two numbers is an odd number. The reason why even numbers are better for roulette is because there are 18 red slots and 18 black slots on the wheel. This means that there’s an equal chance of landing on either color. An odd number would only have a 17% chance of winning, while an even number would have a 50% chance of winning.

In addition, most casinos offer a payout of 3-to-2 for even money bets. This means that if you were to bet $10 on an even number, you would get back $15 if you win. An odd number would only pay out at 2-to-1, which means that you would only get back $12 if you won.

So, next time you’re playing roulette, make sure that you bet on even numbers in order to increase your chances of winning!
