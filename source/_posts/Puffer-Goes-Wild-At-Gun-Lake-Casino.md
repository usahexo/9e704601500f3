#  Puffer Goes Wild At Gun Lake Casino

The Puffer fish is a small, spiny fish that is native to the waters of Asia. The puffer has a smooth, elongated body with a sharp dorsal fin and a poisonous flesh. In some areas, it is considered a delicacy and is often eaten as sushi.

But on September 18, 2017, things went a little too wild for the puffer fish at Gun Lake Casino in Wayland, Michigan. According to reports from the casino, a puffer fish was found swimming in one of the main gaming areas of the casino.

While the puffer posed no danger to humans, it did create quite a spectacle as casino staff and guests scrambled to get out of its way. Staff eventually managed to corral the puffer in a corner and released it back into its natural habitat.

This isn't the first time that Gun Lake Casino has had an encounter with an exotic fish. In May of 2017, a piranha was found in one of the casino's still ponds.

#  Puffer Produces Huge Payout At Gun Lake Casino

The Puffer was the big winner at Gun Lake Casino this week. The $2 machine paid out more than $52,000 to one lucky player.

“It’s always great to see a big win on the Puffer,” said Casino spokesperson Brandon Matthews. “This is one of our most popular machines, and it’s always exciting when it pays out big.”

The Puffer is a three-reel, five-payline machine that is known for its huge payouts. The top jackpot is 1,000 coins, or $10,000 on a max bet.

Matthews said the casino has seen a number of large payouts on the Puffer in recent months. In December, one lucky player took home more than $27,000 on the machine.

“The Puffer is definitely one of our luckiest machines,” Matthews said.

#  Casino Dealer Hits Jackpot With Puffer

A casino dealer who hit a jackpot with a puffer fish says the experience was a “once in a lifetime” event.

The dealer, who chose to remain anonymous, said he was stunned when the puffer, which he had been handling carefully, suddenly started moving and then opened its mouth to reveal the two $100 bills inside.

“It was like something out of a movie,” he said. “I just couldn’t believe it was happening.”

According to casino officials, it is not unusual for dealers to mishandle puffer fish – which can inflate themselves up to 3 times their size when threatened – but it is the first time they have ever seen one spit out money.

The dealer said he plans to use the money to buy a new car and take his family on vacation.

#  Puffer Wild On The Tables At Gun Lake Casino

The Gun Lake Casino will soon be the home of Michigan’s first 24/7 poker room, and with that comes a new game called Puffer. The game is a combination of poker and blackjack and has quickly become popular in casinos throughout the Midwest.

Players can expect to find a mix of Texas Hold’em and blackjack tables at the Gun Lake Casino, each with their own minimum bet. While the strategy for playing Puffer is not overly complex, it does take some skill and practice to become proficient.

The object of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points or by having a higher poker hand than the dealer. In order to win, players must first place an “ante” bet, which is similar to a blackjack bet. They then receive two cards face up and must decide whether to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with their current total).

After all players have had their turn, the dealer flips over his two cards. If he has a total of 21 or less, he must take another card (hit). If his total is 22 or more, he must stand. The dealer then compares his cards to those of the players, awarding wins and losses accordingly.

As with blackjack, players can also choose to double down on their bet or split their hand if they are dealt two cards of the same rank. In Puffer, these options are available after the player has hit or stood on their first two cards.

While there are a few house rules that differ from traditional blackjack, such as doubling down being allowed on any two cards and Widow’s Peek (where the dealer reveals one card from the deck before playing out his hand), Puffer is essentially just another variation of blackjack. This makes it an ideal game for players who are looking for something a little more challenging than regular blackjack but who don’t want to learn an entirely new set of rules.
