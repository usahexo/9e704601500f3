Between these two cards, players are trying to achieve a total value of 21 – or as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the player’s first two cards add up to 21, they automatically win the hand. </p>
<p>If the player busts (goes over 21), then they lose the hand, no matter what the dealer’s card total is. In addition, if the dealer has a ten or an ace showing (called a ‘natural’), they must stop drawing cards and reveal their hand. If the dealer has 16 or less points showing, they must hit (take another card). </p>
<p>If the dealer has 17 or more points showing, they must stand (stick with their current total). Winning hands are paid out at 1:1 odds, while losing hands lose the bet amount placed. Blackjack can be played with anywhere from one to eight decks of cards, and uses standard poker rankings for its suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades). </p>
<p>In order to increase your chances of winning at blackjack, it’s important to understand some basic strategy principles. For example, if you have an Ace and a six as your first two cards (total 7), you should always hit regardless of what the dealer has shown. This is because there is a higher probability that you will get another Ace or a ten (giving you 21), than there is that you will get a seven or lower total (which would result in a bust). </p>
<p>As with any casino game, blackjack also features an element of chance. However, making smart choices about when to hit and when to stand can help improve your odds considerably. For more tips on how to play blackjack – and how to beat the house edge – keep reading below! </p>
<h2 id="The-Basics-of-Blackjack"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Blackjack"></a>The Basics of Blackjack</h2><p>The aim of blackjack is very simple: achieve a total card value of 21 using two or more cards; or get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you go over 21 then you bust and automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s card total is; if the dealer goes over 21 then all players still in the game win even money on their bets. If your first two cards equal 21 then you win automatically - this is called a Blackjack. </p>
<p>Some casinos use just one deck of 52 playing cards but most use several decks shuffled together (the number used ranges from 1 up to 8 - usually it’s around 6 decks). The suits don’t matter in Blackjack - only the numerical values of each card count. So for example 3♣ and 5♥ would count as 8 points altogether but A♠ and 2♦ would only count as 2 points together even though they both are Spades. 10♦ through 2♣ are worth face value eg 10 &#x3D; 10 points, J &#x3D; 11 points etc., K &amp; A are each worth 14 points so a combination like 5♥K♦ would be worth 19 pts altogether (5 + 14 &#x3D; 19). </p>
<p>The other key rules in BlackJack are that you can ask for as many extra cards as you like until you either go over 21 OR decide to stick with what you’ve got (‘stand’); BUT if the Dealer also asks for extra cards and goes over 21 he&#x2F;she busts just like any player do if they go over 21 - so it’s risky for them to ask for more than 1 extra card!. When both Players AND Dealers have finished getting extra cards if anyone’s total is still below 21 then everyone still standing wins their bet amounts - this goes against normal Poker where only hands winning at showdown share prize money equally among all players left in contest at end.. In early BlackJack games Dealers stood on stiff totals like 16 but nowadays due many Dealers hitting soft 17 so unless joined by very weak Players side bet I’d now recommend always splitting Aces &amp; 8’s no matter what Dealer shows.. There’s also optional bets available which give better odds such as “3 Card Poker” which I cover later on.. </p>

As discussed earlier, when playing blackjack your aim should be either: Get as close to 21 pts without going bust; OR Bust the Dealer whilst keeping your own hand value above theirs.. In fact most times it’s advantageous overall NOT busted yourself but make sure Dealer goes Bust instead! So here are few key basic Tips whenever playing BJ: </p>
<p>If dealt 2 starting Cards adding up totalling say 12 pts: Hit- ie take another card even though Dealer likely has low score showing eg 4 or 5 etc.; Take another card ESPEC</p>
<h1 id="How-Michael-Crichton-Distributes-Chips-in-Blackjack"><a href="#How-Michael-Crichton-Distributes-Chips-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="How Michael Crichton Distributes Chips in Blackjack"></a>How Michael Crichton Distributes Chips in Blackjack</h1><p>In a blackjack game, the dealer distributes chips to the players. Michael Crichton, a mathematician and blackjack player, devised a method for distributing chips that guarantees all players will receive an equal number of chips.</p>
<p>Crichton’s distribution method is simple. He starts by placing one chip in the middle of the table. The dealer then divides the remaining chips equally between the players, giving each player one chip less than the player on their left. When there are no more chips to distribute, the dealer gives the last chip to the player on their left.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: Suppose there are six players at a blackjack table and the dealer has 24 chips. Crichton would divide the 24 chips into six piles of four chips each and place one pile in the middle of the table. The dealer would then give two chips to each of the first five players (one chip less than the player on their left) and keep one chip for themselves. When there are no more chips to give, the dealer would give their last chip to the player on their left, who would then have five chips.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-from-Michael-Crichton-on-Chip-Distribution-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Tips-from-Michael-Crichton-on-Chip-Distribution-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Tips from Michael Crichton on Chip Distribution in Blackjack"></a>Tips from Michael Crichton on Chip Distribution in Blackjack</h1><p>Renowned science fiction writer and author of “Jurassic Park”, Michael Crichton, has revealed some valuable tips on how to beat the casino at blackjack. In an excerpt from his book “Blackjack: The Real Deal” which was published in the March&#x2F;April 2007 issue of “Gambling Secrets Magazine”, Crichton discusses chip distribution and how it can help improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Crichton’s advice is to place a greater proportion of your chips on the table when you have a good hand, and conversely, put less chips into play when your hand is weak. This approach is based on the assumption that the casino will adjust its betting in response to your increased bets, and by doing so, you can win more money with a strong hand and lose less when your hand is weak.</p>
<p>In addition, Crichton recommends spreading your bets out over as many hands as possible in order to minimize losses when you have a bad hand. This will also force the casino to make larger bets in order to win back their money, increasing the potential payoff if you do manage to win.</p>
<p>Follow these tips closely and you’ll be on your way to winning at blackjack!</p>
<h1 id="Wisdom-from-Michael-Crichton-on-Chips-and-Blackjack"><a href="#Wisdom-from-Michael-Crichton-on-Chips-and-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Wisdom from Michael Crichton on Chips and Blackjack"></a>Wisdom from Michael Crichton on Chips and Blackjack</h1><p>“You can’t rely on luck in blackjack. You have to make your own luck.”</p>
<p>This quote by Michael Crichton is an important lesson for anyone looking to improve their game at blackjack. There’s no doubt that some luck is always involved in any casino game, but blackjack is one of the few where you can influence the outcome to a significant degree by making correct decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that experience and knowledge aren’t valuable assets. To be successful at blackjack, it’s essential to have a good understanding of the basic rules and strategies. But even if you’re a beginner, you can improve your chances of winning by following some simple tips.</p>
<p>For starters, it’s important to choose wisely when it comes to the casino you’re playing at. Not all casinos offer the same odds, so do your research before deciding where to play. The most advantageous games are offered at casinos that use six decks of cards, and dealer stands on soft 17 (Ace-6).</p>
<p>Another key factor in winning at blackjack is managing your bankroll properly. Don’t gamble with more money than you can afford to lose, and always have a plan for how much you’re going to bet on each hand. This will help you stay in control and minimize your losses if things don’t go your way.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that blackjack is a game of strategy as well as luck. Making smart decisions based on the cards that are dealt will give you a better chance of winning in the long run. So while Lady Luck may still have a role to play, her influence can be reduced greatly by using sound strategy</p>
<h1 id="Learn-from-the-Master-Michael-Crichton’s-Tips-for-Distributing-Chips-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Learn-from-the-Master-Michael-Crichton’s-Tips-for-Distributing-Chips-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Learn from the Master: Michael Crichton’s Tips for Distributing Chips in Blackjack"></a>Learn from the Master: Michael Crichton’s Tips for Distributing Chips in Blackjack</h1><p>There’s no question that Michael Crichton was a master of the casino game blackjack. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the tips and techniques that he used to ensure consistent wins at the blackjack table.</p>
<p>One of Crichton’s most important tips was to distribute his chips in a consistent manner. By spreading out his chips in an even pattern, he ensured that he would have enough chips left to make necessary plays when the opportunity arose. When you’re playing blackjack, it’s important to be aggressive, but also to make sure that you have enough chips left to take advantage of good opportunities.</p>
<p>Crichton was also a master of misdirection. He would often act as if he was losing on purpose, in order to lull the dealer into a false sense of security. Then, when the time was right, he would unleash a flurry of winning hands and take down the pot. You can use this same strategy by making small bets early in the game, in order to lure the dealer into giving you good cards. Then, when it’s time to go on a streak, increase your bets and take down the pot.</p>
<p>Finally, Crichton was a big proponent of card counting. By keeping track of which cards have already been played, he was able to make informed decisions about when to bet and when to hold back. This can be a difficult skill to learn, but it’s certainly worth the effort if you want to improve your chances of winning at blackjack.</p>
<p>Michael Crichton was one of the best blackjack players in history, and by following his tips and techniques you too can become a winner at the casino table.</p>
