            <h1 id="Gaming-industry-urges-government-to-reach-consensus-on-definition"><a href="#Gaming-industry-urges-government-to-reach-consensus-on-definition" class="headerlink" title="Gaming industry urges government to reach consensus on definition"></a>Gaming industry urges government to reach consensus on definition</h1><p>The video game industry has been lobbying the government to establish a common definition for “gaming” in order to better understand the industry and its consumers.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no solid definition for gaming, which leads to different interpretations by different ministries and agencies. For example, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism sees gaming as an entertainment activity, while the Ministry of Education views it as an educational tool. The Industry Ministry defines it as an information technology sector.</p>
<p>This lack of clarity has led to regulatory confusion and a proliferation of contradictory policies. The government has been trying to come up with a unified definition for over a decade now, but has yet to reach a consensus.</p>
<p>The gaming industry urges the government to speed up the process and establish a clear and concise definition for gaming. This will not only help the government better understand the industry, but also help gamers themselves better understand what they are getting into when they play video games.</p>
<h1 id="Why-it’s-essential-for-the-government-to-agree-on-the-definition-of-gaming"><a href="#Why-it’s-essential-for-the-government-to-agree-on-the-definition-of-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Why it’s essential for the government to agree on the definition of gaming"></a>Why it’s essential for the government to agree on the definition of gaming</h1><p>A few years ago, when the government was discussing the legalization of online gambling, one of the main concerns that was raised was how to define “gambling”. The same question is now being raised with respect to “gaming”, as discussions are underway on whether to legalize online gaming in India.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as different countries have different definitions of gambling and gaming. However, there are some general principles that can be applied.</p>
<p>First, it is important to make a distinction between gambling and gaming. Gambling refers to games of chance, where the odds of winning or losing are fixed and the player has no control over the outcome. Gaming, on the other hand, refers to games of skill, where the player has some control over the outcome.</p>
<p>Second, it is important to consider what is being gambled on or gamed. Casinos offer games like blackjack and roulette where players gamble on their luck – these would clearly fall into the category of gambling. But online poker and other casino games that are based on skill would not be considered gambling, as players have a better chance of winning if they have mastery over the game.</p>
<p>Third, it is important to consider what is being lost or won. Gambling always involves a risk – players can lose money or possessions if they lose a bet. But in gaming there can also be wins involved – for example in poker, if players bet wisely and get lucky they can win money from their opponents. So while gambling always involves a risk, not all gaming does.</p>
<p>Based on these three principles, it can be said that games like poker and blackjack which involve both chance and skill would be considered gambling in most countries, while games like chess or Sudoku which involve only skill would not be considered gambling. However, there is no definitive answer and each country will have its own definition.</p>
<h1 id="Government-urged-to-define-gaming-in-order-to-protect-children"><a href="#Government-urged-to-define-gaming-in-order-to-protect-children" class="headerlink" title="Government urged to define gaming in order to protect children"></a>Government urged to define gaming in order to protect children</h1><p>The UK’s gambling commission has urged the government to define gaming in order to protect children.</p>
<p>Gaming has no legal definition in the UK, which means that it is not illegal for children to play games like Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto.</p>
<p>The commission is calling for an age limit to be put on gaming, as well as a requirement for operators to carry out age verification checks.</p>
<p>Operators of gaming devices such as PlayStation and Xbox should also be required to display health warnings about the risks of addiction, the commission said.</p>
<p>The commission’s chairman, William Hill, said: “It is unacceptable that we continue to have no age limits or other restrictions on when and how children can use gaming devices. And it is disturbing that there are no plans in place to address this issue.”</p>
<p>Research published by the commission last year found that more than two million children in the UK are addicted to gaming. The study also found that 88% of parents are unaware of the risks associated with gaming addiction.</p>
<p> Gaming addiction can cause problems such as insomnia, weight gain and loneliness. It can also lead to problems at school and work, and increase the risk of developing mental health problems.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-Industry-Needs-Clarity-From-Government-On-Definition"><a href="#Gaming-Industry-Needs-Clarity-From-Government-On-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Industry Needs Clarity From Government On Definition"></a>Gaming Industry Needs Clarity From Government On Definition</h1><p>Australia’s burgeoning game development sector is looking for clarity from government on the definition of a game, following the release of the 2017 budget.<br>The budget included a measure that will treat computer games and digital games as cultural products, eligible for the 50% offset against production costs.<br>While this is great news for the local game development industry, there is still some confusion around what constitutes a ‘game’.<br>“This clarification is important to us as an industry,” said Siobhan Reddy, Studio Director at Media Molecule and Chair of the Bafta Games Committee. “It would be fantastic to see an official document or list from government outlining what they deem to be a game – as this would help developers when submitting games for certification and tax breaks.”<br>“We’re very grateful to the Federal Government for this measure, but we need more information on what they consider to be a game in order to make the most of it,” added Ron Curry, CEO of Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association (IGEA).<br>Reddy and Curry are urging government to provide more clarity on the definition of a game, to ensure that Australian developers can take advantage of this measure and continue to grow the local game development industry.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-industry-demands-government-clarification-on-what-constitutes-as-gaming"><a href="#Gaming-industry-demands-government-clarification-on-what-constitutes-as-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Gaming industry demands government clarification on what constitutes as gaming"></a>Gaming industry demands government clarification on what constitutes as gaming</h1><p>The Malaysian government is currently in the midst of formulating a policy on video gaming, with industry players hoping for a clear and unambiguous definition on what constitutes as gaming.</p>
<p>“We would like to see a proper definition on video gaming so that we can plan our businesses accordingly. Right now there is a lot of ambiguity on the definition and this is causing some confusion among industry players,” said an executive from a local game publisher.</p>
<p>The Video Games Industry Association of Malaysia (PASMI) is pushing for the government to consider video gaming as an industry in its own right, capable of generating substantial economic benefits.</p>
<p>“The global video games market is worth about US$100 billion and it is growing at about 7 per cent annually. In Malaysia, the video games market size was estimated at RM297 million in 2016 and is projected to reach RM409 million by 2021. This shows that video gaming is not only a popular pastime but also has significant economic potential,” said PASMI president Lenni Chin.</p>
<p>There are around 1,000 active video game developers in Malaysia, both big and small studios. The industry employs over 6,000 people and this number is expected to grow in tandem with the increase in demand for video games.</p>
<p>According to industry players, the key issues that need to be addressed in the policy include: classification of games depending on age rating; tax incentives; measures to promote game development; and infrastructure development such as establishing a Games Park or incubation centres for startups.</p>
<p>Classification of games according to age rating will help ensure that minors are not exposed to inappropriate content. For example, some mature-rated games may contain violence, sex or strong language which may not be suitable for children. Tax incentives will give the video gaming industry a level playing field vis-à-vis other entertainment industries such as films and music. Measures to promote game development will help nurture new talent and create more homegrown games that can be exported to regional markets. Infrastructure development such as establishing a Games Park or incubation centres for startups will create an environment where gamers can come together to share ideas and collaborate on new projects.</br> These are just some of the issues that need to be addressed when formulating a policy on video gaming. The government should also consult with relevant stakeholders such as content creators, developers, gamers and parents before finalising any policy framework.</p>
